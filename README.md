# The Office Trivia Game

https://office-trivia-game.vercel.app/

This project is a copy of another Office Trivia Game, however it's built in ReactJS.

Questions for each difficulty are randomized that way each time you play, it's a different set of questions presented to the player. Guess a question correctly, and gain 5 points to your total score. Guess a question incorrectly, and no harm will come to your total score.

See at the end our thoughts on your level of Office fandom!
